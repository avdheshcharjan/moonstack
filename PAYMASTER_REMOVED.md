# Paymaster/Gas Sponsorship Removed

## What Changed

**Removed paymaster/gas sponsorship** from batch execution to simplify the demo implementation.

### Before (With Paymaster)
```typescript
// wallet_sendCalls with gas sponsorship
capabilities: {
  paymasterService: {
    url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMASTER_URL,
  },
}
```

**How it worked:**
- Paymaster (via Coinbase CDP) paid for gas fees
- Users only needed USDC for bets
- No ETH required in wallet
- More complex setup with additional configuration

### After (Without Paymaster)
```typescript
// wallet_sendCalls without paymaster - simpler setup
{
  version: '2.0.0',
  from: userAddress,
  calls: calls,
  chainId: numberToHex(base.constants.CHAIN_IDS.base),
  atomicRequired: true,
  // No capabilities/paymasterService
}
```

**How it works now:**
- Users pay their own gas fees with ETH
- Users need both USDC (for bets) and ETH (for gas)
- Simpler setup - no paymaster configuration needed
- Easier to debug - fewer moving parts

## What Users Need

### Before
- ✅ USDC for bets
- ❌ ETH not needed (paymaster covered gas)

### Now
- ✅ USDC for bets (~$0.1 - $10 depending on bet size)
- ✅ ETH for gas fees (~0.001 - 0.01 ETH per batch)

## Benefits of This Change

1. **Faster to implement** - No paymaster setup required
2. **Easier to debug** - One less service to configure and monitor
3. **Simpler architecture** - Direct transactions without intermediary
4. **Standard flow** - How most dApps work
5. **Good for demo** - Can test end-to-end without waiting for paymaster approval

## Drawbacks

1. **Users need ETH** - Slightly worse UX (need 2 tokens instead of 1)
2. **Gas costs** - Users pay ~$0.01-0.10 per batch in gas fees

## How to Re-enable Paymaster (If Needed)

If you want to bring back gas sponsorship later:

1. **Restore the capabilities in `batchExecution.ts`:**
```typescript
capabilities: {
  paymasterService: {
    url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMASTER_URL,
  },
}
```

2. **Ensure .env has valid paymaster URL:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMASTER_URL=https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

3. **Get credentials from:** https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com

## File Changed

- **`src/services/batchExecution.ts:248-256`** - Removed `capabilities.paymasterService`

## Testing Checklist

With paymaster removed, ensure users have:

- [ ] Base Account wallet connected
- [ ] USDC balance for bets (check in console: "User USDC balance")
- [ ] **ETH balance for gas** (~0.01 ETH recommended)
- [ ] Fresh orders in cart (<5 minutes old)

## Expected Console Output

```
[batchExecution] wallet_sendCalls params: {
  version: '2.0.0',
  from: '0x...',
  callsCount: 2,
  chainId: '0x2105',
  atomicRequired: true,
  usingPaymaster: false  ← This confirms paymaster is disabled
}
```
