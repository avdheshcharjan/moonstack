# Base Account Only - Clean Implementation

## ✅ What Was Changed

All external wallet extensions (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) have been completely removed. Your app now **ONLY supports Base Account** and requires users to "Sign in with Base" on every page load.

---

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. **Removed Auto-Reconnect** (`src/hooks/useWallet.ts`)

**Before**: The app would auto-reconnect using localStorage, potentially reconnecting to MetaMask or other wallets.

**After**: 
- ❌ **No auto-reconnect** on page reload
- ✅ **User must "Sign in with Base" every time** they visit the page
- ✅ Only Base Account SDK provider is used
- ✅ Disconnects if user switches away from Base chain

```typescript
// NO AUTO-RECONNECT - User must "Sign in with Base" on every page load
// This ensures a fresh session and prevents any cached wallet states
```

### 2. **Removed Wagmi & Other Wallet Connectors** (`src/providers/BaseAccountProvider.tsx`)

**Before**: Used WagmiProvider and QueryClient which could inject other wallet providers.

**After**:
- ❌ Removed WagmiProvider
- ❌ Removed QueryClient
- ❌ Removed wallet connectors
- ✅ **Only Base Account SDK** is initialized
- ✅ Clean provider with no external dependencies

```typescript
// Clean provider - no wagmi, no other wallet connectors
export function BaseAccountProvider({ children }: BaseAccountProviderProps): JSX.Element {
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

### 3. **Fixed Cart to Use Base Account** (`src/components/cart/CartModal.tsx`)

**Before**: Used `useAccount` from wagmi which could connect to any wallet.

**After**:
- ❌ Removed `useAccount` from wagmi
- ✅ Uses `useWallet` hook (Base Account only)
- ✅ All transactions go through Base Account provider

```typescript
import { useWallet } from '@/src/hooks/useWallet';
// ...
const { walletAddress } = useWallet();
```

### 4. **Base Account for All Transactions** (`src/lib/basePaymaster.ts`)

**Before**: Was trying to use `window.ethereum` (MetaMask).

**After**:
- ❌ No `window.ethereum` access
- ✅ **Only Base Account SDK provider**
- ✅ All transactions signed with Base Account
- ✅ Gasless transactions via Base Paymaster

```typescript
// Get the Base Account SDK provider (NOT window.ethereum/MetaMask)
const baseProvider = baseAccountSDK.getProvider();
console.log('✅ Using Base Account provider for transactions');
```
