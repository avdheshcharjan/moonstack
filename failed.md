The error message **“failed to estimate gas for user operation: useroperation reverted: execution reverted”** indicates that the **simulation or estimation phase of your UserOperation failed** — most likely because the **underlying smart contract call reverted** during execution or simulation. This is common when working with ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) or Paymaster-based systems.

### Common Causes
1. **Insufficient Gas Allocation**
   - The gas limits (`callGasLimit`, `verificationGasLimit`, `preVerificationGas`) may be set too low for the operation’s complexity.
   - The operation reverts because the EVM cannot complete all instructions with the gas provided.[1][2]
   - Try **increasing `preVerificationGas` or `callGasLimit`**, and resimulate the operation using the EntryPoint contract.

2. **Smart Contract Logic Revert**
   - The execution failed due to a logical condition inside your smart contract (such as `require` or `revert` statements).[2][4]
   - Examples: transferring tokens exceeding the sender’s balance, invalid input data, or insufficient token approvals.

3. **Invalid `callData` or `initCode`**
   - If you’re using a bundler or paymaster flow, malformed or incorrectly encoded function data will trigger this revert.[1]

4. **Insufficient Account Balance**
   - The account or paymaster does not have enough funds to cover gas or operation costs. Even reverted transactions consume gas fees.[5]

5. **Outdated or Invalid Signatures**
   - For Paymaster or smart accounts, modifying the UserOperation after obtaining a signature can invalidate it, causing a revert at the validation step.[1]

6. **Network or RPC Mismatch**
   - Using a mainnet endpoint while testing on a testnet (or vice versa) leads to invalid chain IDs and revert errors.[1]

### How to Debug
1. **Simulate using EntryPoint**  
   Use the contract method `simulateHandleOp()` on the EntryPoint (`0x5ff137d4b0fdcd49dca30c7cf57e578a026d2789`) with your full UserOperation to see detailed revert data.[1]

2. **Decode the error**
   - Copy the revert hex data and decode it using an ABI decoder (e.g., bia.is/tools/abi-decoder).
   - Supply the ABI of the contract you were calling to extract the revert reason.

3. **Use Tenderly or Foundry Debugging**
   - These tools can simulate and visualize the cause of the revert directly in your smart contract execution trace.[1]

4. **Manual Testing**
   - Try executing the equivalent contract function directly via Hardhat console or Etherscan “Write Contract” to confirm whether it reverts outside the UserOperation flow.

### Summary of Fixes
| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Low gas | Increase `callGasLimit` and `preVerificationGas` [1] |
| Contract logic error | Check `require` conditions and function inputs [2][4] |
| Invalid callData | Verify ABI encoding and sender data [1] |
| Insufficient balance | Fund the account/paymaster adequately [5] |
| Signature mismatch | Re-sign the UserOperation after every change [1] |

In short, this error occurs because the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) simulation failed — either due to insufficient gas, invalid contract state, or revert conditions. Begin by raising gas parameters and decoding the revert data to pinpoint the cause.
