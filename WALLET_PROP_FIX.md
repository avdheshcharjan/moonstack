# Fixed: Wallet Address Not Found in Cart

## 🎯 Problem

User connects wallet successfully, swipes cards to add to cart, but when clicking "Approve All" gets:
```
🔍 Cart approval check: {address: null, walletAddress: null, hasAddress: false}
❌ No wallet address found in cart
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue was **prop drilling**:

1. **Moonstack** component connects the wallet → has `walletAddress` state
2. **TopBar** component (sibling) renders **CartModal**
3. **CartModal** tried to use `useWallet()` hook independently
4. React state from hooks isn't automatically shared across different parts of the component tree

```
Moonstack (has walletAddress ✅)
  ├─ Content (gets walletAddress ✅)
  └─ TopBar (didn't get walletAddress ❌)
       └─ CartModal (tried useWallet() but got null ❌)
```

## ✅ Solution: Prop Drilling

Pass `walletAddress` down through the component tree:

```
Moonstack (has walletAddress)
  ↓ pass as prop
TopBar (receives walletAddress)
  ↓ pass as prop
CartModal (receives walletAddress) ✅
```

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Moonstack.tsx** - Pass wallet to TopBar
```typescript
// Before
<TopBar />

// After
<TopBar walletAddress={walletAddress} />
```

### 2. **TopBar.tsx** - Accept and forward wallet
```typescript
// Before
interface TopBarProps {}
const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = () => {

// After
interface TopBarProps {
  walletAddress: string | null;
}
const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = ({ walletAddress }) => {

// Forward to CartModal
<CartModal
  isOpen={isCartOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsCartOpen(false)}
  onCartUpdate={handleCartUpdate}
  walletAddress={walletAddress}  // ← Added
/>
```

### 3. **CartModal.tsx** - Receive wallet as prop
```typescript
// Before
import { useWallet } from '@/src/hooks/useWallet';

interface CartModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onCartUpdate?: () => void;
}

export function CartModal({ isOpen, onClose, onCartUpdate }: CartModalProps) {
  const { walletAddress } = useWallet();  // ← This returned null
  const address = walletAddress;

// After
interface CartModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onCartUpdate?: () => void;
  walletAddress: string | null;  // ← Added
}

export function CartModal({ isOpen, onClose, onCartUpdate, walletAddress }: CartModalProps) {
  const address = walletAddress;  // ← Direct prop
  
  // Debug logging
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('🔍 CartModal received wallet address:', { walletAddress, address });
  }, [walletAddress, address]);
```
