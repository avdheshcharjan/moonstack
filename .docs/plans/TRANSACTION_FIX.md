# Transaction Fix Summary

## Problem
Swipe transactions were **not going through** because the code was missing a critical step required by the OptionBook protocol.

## Root Cause
The `directExecution.ts` file was **missing the USDC approval step** before calling `fillOrder()`.

According to **OptionBook.md section 2.4**, the required flow is:
1. ✅ Check USDC balance
2. ❌ **Check USDC allowance** (MISSING)
3. ❌ **Approve USDC if needed** (MISSING)
4. ✅ Call fillOrder

Without step 2-3, the OptionBook contract cannot transfer USDC from the user's wallet, causing all transactions to fail.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `src/services/directExecution.ts`
Added the missing approval logic:

```typescript
// Step 3: Check USDC allowance and approve if needed (per OptionBook.md section 2.4)
const currentAllowance = await checkUSDCAllowance(userAddress, OPTION_BOOK_ADDRESS as Address);

if (currentAllowance < requiredAmount) {
  console.log('Approving USDC for OptionBook...');
  
  // Create USDC contract instance
  const usdcContract = new Contract(USDC_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, signer);
  
  // Approve USDC spending
  const approveTx = await usdcContract.approve(OPTION_BOOK_ADDRESS, requiredAmount);
  console.log('Approval transaction submitted:', approveTx.hash);
  
  // Wait for approval to be mined
  const approvalReceipt = await approveTx.wait();
  
  if (!approvalReceipt || approvalReceipt.status !== 1) {
    throw new Error('USDC approval failed');
  }
  
  console.log('USDC approval confirmed');
} else {
  console.log('USDC already approved, current allowance:', Number(currentAllowance) / 1_000_000, 'USDC');
}
```

### 2. Updated imports
- Added `checkUSDCAllowance` from `@/src/utils/usdcApproval`
- Added `USDC_ADDRESS` and `ERC20_ABI` from `@/src/utils/contracts`
- Added `Contract` from `ethers`

### 3. Updated `src/utils/contracts.ts`
Added `balanceOf` function to the ERC20_ABI for completeness.

## Transaction Flow (After Fix)

When a user swipes right/left:

1. **SwipeableCard** detects swipe gesture
2. **CardStack** calls `handleSwipe('yes')` or `handleSwipe('no')`
3. **SwipeView** calls `executeDirectFillOrder(pair, action, betSize, walletAddress)`
4. **directExecution.ts** executes:
   - ✅ Validates wallet connection
   - ✅ Checks USDC balance
   - ✅ **Checks USDC allowance**
   - ✅ **Approves USDC if needed** (NEW!)
   - ✅ Prepares order parameters
   - ✅ Calls `fillOrder()` on OptionBook contract
   - ✅ Waits for transaction confirmation
   - ✅ Stores position in database

## User Experience

### First Swipe
Users will see **TWO transactions**:
1. **Approval transaction** - Approve USDC spending (one-time)
2. **fillOrder transaction** - Execute the actual bet

### Subsequent Swipes
Users will see **ONE transaction** (the approval is already done):
1. **fillOrder transaction** - Execute the bet

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Swipe right (PUMP/bullish bet) triggers approval + fillOrder
- [ ] Swipe left (DUMP/bearish bet) triggers approval + fillOrder
- [ ] Second swipe only triggers fillOrder (approval already granted)
- [ ] Check console logs show approval steps
- [ ] Verify transactions appear on BaseScan
- [ ] Verify positions are stored in database

## Important Notes

1. **Approval is persistent** - Once approved, users don't need to approve again unless they revoke it
2. **Gas costs** - First transaction costs more gas (approval + fillOrder)
3. **User must confirm both transactions** - Approval, then fillOrder
4. **Allowance check** - Code checks existing allowance to avoid unnecessary approvals

## ⚠️ Additional Configuration Needed

### Referrer Address
The current `REFERRER_ADDRESS` is set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001` in `src/utils/contracts.ts`.

According to **OptionBook.md section 2.2**, you should:
- Use a **unique wallet address** for your platform
- This address identifies positions created through your platform
- Allows filtering user positions by referrer
- May earn referral fees in future versions

**Recommendation**: Update `REFERRER_ADDRESS` to a dedicated wallet address for your platform (e.g., a multisig or dedicated EOA).
