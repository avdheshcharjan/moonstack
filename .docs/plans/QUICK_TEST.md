# 🚀 Quick Test Guide

## Issue
- ❌ Only 1 transaction executes instead of 2
- ❌ Paymaster doesn't sponsor gas

## Fix Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING**

## Quick Test (5 minutes)

### 1. Setup Environment
Create `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMASTER_URL=https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUNDLER_URL=https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Start App
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test
1. Connect Base Account
2. Swipe RIGHT on 2 cards (1 USDC each)
3. Open cart → should show "2" transactions
4. Click "Approve All (2)"
5. **CHECK BASE ACCOUNT POPUP** ← CRITICAL

### 4. Verify Success
✅ Base Account shows: **-2.000000 USDC** (not -1!)  
✅ ETH balance: **unchanged** (gas sponsored)  
✅ Console shows: **"Encoding batch of 2 transactions"**

## Expected Console Output

```
========================================
🚀 GASLESS BATCH EXECUTION STARTING
========================================
📦 Total transactions: 2
💰 Total USDC needed: 2000000

🔧 Creating Smart Account with Paymaster...

========================================
✅ BATCH EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL!

```

## ✅ Success = 2 USDC spent + 0 ETH gas
