# 🎯 TEST NOW - Gas Estimation Error Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Error**: `failed to estimate gas for user operation: useroperation reverted`  
**Cause**: Missing USDC approval in batch  
**Fix**: Automatically adds USDC approval as first transaction in batch

## 🧪 Quick Test (2 minutes)

### 1. Refresh Browser
```
Hard refresh: Cmd + Shift + R (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
```

### 2. Connect & Test
1. **Connect** Base Account wallet
2. **Swipe RIGHT** on 2 cards (1 USDC each)
3. **Open cart** → should show "2" transactions
4. **Click "Approve All (2)"**

### 3. What to Expect

**Base Account Popup**:
- Shows batch transaction request
- Asset changes: **-2.000000 USDC** (not -1!)

**Browser Console** should show:
```
🔍 Checking USDC approval...
✅ Adding USDC approval to batch
📦 Batch includes:
  1. USDC Approval for 2.00 USDC
  2-3. Fill 2 order(s)
✅ Batch transaction submitted and mined!
```

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ No gas estimation error
- ✅ Both transactions execute
- ✅ 2 USDC spent (not 1!)
- ✅ Cart clears
- ✅ Success message appears

## ❌ If Still Fails

### Check Console for:

1. **"Insufficient USDC balance"**
   - Make sure you have at least 2+ USDC

2. **"Order already filled" or "Order expired"**
   - Try swiping different cards (fresh orders)

3. **Other errors**
   - Copy full console output
   - Check that you're using Base Account (not MetaMask)

## 📊 Expected Results

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Gas estimation error | ✅ FIXED |
| Only 1 transaction executes | ✅ FIXED |
| Both transactions execute | ✅ WORKS |
| Paymaster sponsors gas | ⏳ Needs config |
